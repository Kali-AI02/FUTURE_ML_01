# FUTURE_ML_01


House Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other factors. Using machine learning techniques, the model provides accurate price estimates to aid in real estate decision-making.

#Tools and Libraries
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

#Future Work
Incorporate more features
Experiment with other machine learning algorithms.
Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.
